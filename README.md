## Part 1: Model Training
In Part 1, we trained three types of recurrent neural network models:

1. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**: A basic recurrent neural network architecture suitable for sequential data processing. Despite its simplicity, RNNs can effectively capture temporal dependencies in text data.

2. **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: An enhancement of the standard RNN architecture, GRU incorporates gating mechanisms to better regulate the flow of information through the network, mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.

3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Another variant of the RNN architecture, LSTM introduces a more sophisticated memory cell with input, output, and forget gates, allowing it to retain long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## Dataset
The text data used for training the models consists of various sources related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including news articles, social media posts, and research papers. The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize the text, and handle any missing or irrelevant information.

## Model Training Process
We followed these general steps to train each model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding sequences, and preparing the dataset for training.

2. **Model Architecture**: Defining the architecture of each model using TensorFlow/Keras, including the number of layers, activation functions, and other hyperparameters.

3. **Training**: Training the models on the preprocessed text data using appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of each model on a separate validation dataset, measuring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
All three models (RNN, GRU, LSTM) performed well in the text classification task related to COVID-19. They achieved high accuracy and other evaluation metrics, demonstrating their effectiveness in analyzing and classifying textual data in the context of the pandemic.

## Part 2: Fine-Tuning GPT-2 Model
In Part 2 of the project, we focused on fine-tuning the GPT-2 model using a dataset sourced from Hugging Face. The dataset contained a collection of Arabic text data, including questions and corresponding answers, which were preprocessed and used for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model consisted of Arabic text data extracted from various sources, including online forums, social media platforms, and news articles. The data was preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize the text, and format it for input into the GPT-2 model.

## Fine-Tuning Process
We followed these general steps to fine-tune the GPT-2 model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding sequences, and preparing the dataset for fine-tuning.

2. **Model Configuration**: Configuring the GPT-2 model architecture for the Arabic language, including setting appropriate hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs.

3. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the pre-trained GPT-2 model on the preprocessed Arabic text data using transfer learning techniques. We used techniques such as teacher forcing and beam search decoding during training.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned GPT-2 model on a separate validation dataset, measuring metrics such as perplexity, BLEU score, and human evaluation.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, despite our efforts to fine-tune the GPT-2 model for generating answers in Arabic, the performance of the model was subpar. Addressing the challenges mentioned above, such as improving data quality, increasing training data size, and refining model architecture, may lead to better results in future iterations of the project.

## Part 3: Fine-Tuning BERT Model
In Part 3 of the project, we focused on fine-tuning the BERT model using a dataset containing Amazon reviews. The fine-tuned model was designed to analyze the text content of reviews and provide a numerical score representing the sentiment or quality of each review.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning the BERT model consisted of Amazon reviews spanning various product categories. Each review was accompanied by a numerical rating provided by the reviewer. The data was preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize the text, and format it for input into the BERT model.

## Fine-Tuning Process
We followed these general steps to fine-tune the BERT model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, padding sequences, and preparing the dataset for fine-tuning.

2. **Model Configuration**: Configuring the BERT model architecture for sentiment analysis or review scoring task, including setting appropriate hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs.

3. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on the preprocessed Amazon reviews dataset using transfer learning techniques. We employed techniques such as gradient clipping and early stopping to enhance model performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned BERT model on a separate test dataset, measuring metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results
The fine-tuned BERT model demonstrated excellent performance in scoring Amazon reviews accurately. It achieved high accuracy and other evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in analyzing and scoring textual reviews across different product categories.
